# Impact Match-FrontEnd

## Introduction

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) project that connects to a backend API to display data on the frontend. Please make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed before proceeding.

## Environment Variables Setup

In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file and configure the following environment variable to connect to the backend:

```bash
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

### How to use:

1. Copy the content above into your `README.md` file.
2. Save and commit the file to your Git repository.

This version explicitly includes the `npm install` and `npm start` commands and gives clear instructions with proper markdown formatting.
